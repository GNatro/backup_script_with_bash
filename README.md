# Interactive Backup Script Generator

This repository contains a **Bash script** that interactively collects backup parameters (local source path, remote user, remote host, and remote destination path) and supports three backup methods:

1. **rsync**
2. **scp**
3. **tar + scp** (tar the files locally, then transfer the tarball via scp)

After you select a method and provide the required information, the script **generates a standalone backup script** that you can run anytime. Additionally, you can choose to schedule the backup with cron so it runs automatically.

------

## Features

- **Interactive Prompts**: Collects backup details (source, destination, etc.) step-by-step.
- **Multiple Methods**: Choose from `rsync`, `scp`, or `tar+scp` for your backup.
- **Script Generation**: Creates a **separate backup script** (e.g., `my_backup_script.sh`) with the commands tailored to your chosen method and inputs.
- **Immediate Execution Option**: Optionally run the newly created backup script right away.
- **Cron Integration**: Optionally add a cron entry to schedule the backup script (e.g., daily at 2 AM).

------

## Prerequisites

1. **Bash Shell**: The script runs in a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, etc.).

2. SSH Setup

   :

   - Ensure you have SSH installed.
   - If you want **passwordless backups** (especially for cron), set up SSH key-based authentication with the remote server.

3. **Permissions**: Make the script executable (`chmod +x`).

------

## Usage

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.

2. Make the script executable

   :

   ```bash
   chmod +x generate_backup_script.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./generate_backup_script.sh
   ```

4. Answer the prompts

   :

   - **Backup method** (1 = rsync, 2 = scp, 3 = tar+scp).
   - **Local source path** (e.g., `/home/user/myfolder`).
   - **Remote user** (e.g., `vagrant`).
   - **Remote host/IP** (e.g., `192.168.1.146`).
   - **Remote destination path** (e.g., `/home/vagrant/backups`).
   - **Filename** for the generated script (e.g., `my_backup_script.sh`).

5. Optional

   :

   - Run the newly generated script immediately.
   - Schedule the generated script in **cron**.

------

## Example

Below is a sample walkthrough:

1. Run the generator script:

   ```bash
   ./generate_backup_script.sh
   ```

2. Suppose you select 

   1 for rsync

   , then specify:

   - Local path: `/home/vagrant/data`
   - Remote user: `vagrant`
   - Remote IP: `192.168.1.146`
   - Remote path: `/home/vagrant/backups`
   - Output script name: `my_backup_script.sh`

3. The script will generate 

   `my_backup_script.sh`

    with an rsync command:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Auto-Generated Backup Script
   #
   # Method: rsync
   # Source: /home/vagrant/data
   # Destination: vagrant@192.168.1.146:/home/vagrant/backups
   
   rsync -avz --delete --progress "/home/vagrant/data" "vagrant@192.168.1.146:/home/vagrant/backups"
   ```

4. When prompted, choose whether you want to **run it now** or **schedule in cron**.

------

## Scheduling with Cron

If you choose the cron option, the script appends an entry to your userâ€™s crontab. For instance, entering `0 2 * * *` will run the generated script every day at 2:00 AM.

Check your cron entries via:

```bash
crontab -l
```

------

## Notes & Best Practices

- **SSH Key Authentication**: Highly recommended to avoid typing passwords when running the backup via cron.
- **File Permissions**: Ensure the script is executable (`chmod +x`) and that both local/remote directories have the correct read/write permissions.
- **Tar + scp**: This method compresses data before sending; ensure adequate local storage for the temporary tar file.
- **Error Handling**: This script demonstrates a functional approach. Consider enhancing with additional checks for large-scale/production environments.
